## About Me
I am a beginner data-focused developer building practical tools in Python and C/C++.
My focus is on data cleaning, automation, and simple simulations.
I value correctness, clarity, and robust error handling.

## Project 1: Data Cleaner (Python)

**Description**  
A Python script that loads CSV files, handles missing values, and outputs cleaned datasets.
The script includes user input validation and error handling for common file and data issues.

**Key Features**
- Load CSV files from user-defined paths
- Automatically fill missing values:
  - Numeric → column mean
  - Boolean → False
  - Other types → "Unknown"
- Summary statistics using `describe()`
- Save cleaned data to a specified output path

**Technologies**
- Python
- Pandas

**Repository**

## Project 2: Directory Organizer (Python)

**Description**  
A command-line tool that organizes files in a directory into folders based on file type.

**Key Features**
- Sort files by extension
- Modular design using helper functions
- Versioned development (v1, planned v1.1 improvements)

**Technologies**
- Python
- OS / Path handling

**Repository**
- Link here

## Project 3: Particle Simulation (C++)

**Description**  
A simple particle simulation that updates a particle’s position over time using velocity components.

**Key Features**
- Position updates using basic physics logic
- Clear separation of state and update logic

**Technologies**
- C++

**Repository**
- Link here
