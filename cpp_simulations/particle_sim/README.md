This is a simple particle simulator.
In this simulation we observe how the position values (x, y) of a particle evolve over time.
The update() rule updates the particle based on it's position in the space, if the paticle is not out of bounds, the particle continues evolving till it ends up outside the area that's defined by the (WIDTH*HEIGHT)
