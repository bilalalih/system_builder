My Name is Bilal Alih, I'm a System Builder who makes use of systemic thinking to provide solutions to complex problems.

I build Simulations, Mathemetical Models, and Backend systems.
I make use of python to write scripts that automate tasks, and help to make sense of data through analysis and visualization.

Focus:
I design and build small, reliable automation systems using Python, and I am progressively expanding into backend and simulation-driven system design.

This repository contains practical, end-to-end projects focused on data transformation, automation, and system behavior.
